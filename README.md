**Weatherly** is a modern and intuitive weather app that provides real-time weather updates and insights for any location. Designed with a focus on usability and aesthetics, it ensures you stay informed and prepared, no matter the conditions.

**What I learned while making Weatherly:**

        •API Integration: Gained hands-on experience with fetching, managing, and displaying real-time weather data.
        •React Development: Strengthened my skills in using components and hooks to create interactive interfaces.
        •Error Handling: Implemented robust error management to ensure smooth performance even in case of network issues.
        •UI/UX Design: Focused on creating a visually appealing interface using CSS flexbox, grid, and modern design principles.

Weatherly reflects my growth as a developer, combining functionality, design, and technology to create a practical and reliable website. It’s more than just an app, it’s a testament to the skills and knowledge I’ve developed while working on real-world projects.
